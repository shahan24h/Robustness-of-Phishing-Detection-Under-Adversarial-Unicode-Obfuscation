    CONTEXT:

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. **Avoid Patterns:** Do not start every email with "Dear". Sometimes use "Hi", "Hey", or no greeting.
    2. **Vary Length:** Make some emails 2 sentences long (mobile). Make others 3 paragraphs (desktop).
    3. **Use Realism:** Include typos if the tone is "Sloppy". Include legal jargon if "Legalistic".
    4. **MANDATORY:** USE THE IDENTITIES BELOW. No placeholders like [Name].
