# Adversarial BEC Email Dataset

## What's This?

4,211 synthetic Business Email Compromise (BEC) phishing emails I generated using Gemini Flash 2.5. 

**The twist?** 30% of them are "poisoned" with adversarial tricks that fool AI detectors:
- Cyrillic letters that look identical to English (homoglyphs)
- Invisible Unicode characters that break keyword detection

## Files Included

- `synthetic_bec.csv` - Clean emails
- `synthetic_emails_poisoned.csv` - Adversarially modified emails
- Generation scripts (so you can see exactly how I made them)
